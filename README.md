# CapSensing_FDC2214
This a compact toolkit of capacitive sensing based on FDC2214 from Texas Instrument.

Sources including the hardware files of a capacitive sensing board with FDC2214, the driver files of FDC2214, the firmware code using Arduino BLE Nano as the mother board(of course suitble for other open source boards, even no need for any modification at all.)

Feel free to use, modify, comment, and share.
